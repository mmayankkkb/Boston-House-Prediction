**Data Set Characteristics:**  

- Number of Instances: 506  

- Number of Attributes: 13 numeric/categorical predictive Median Value (attribute 14) is usually the target.


 ## **Attribute Information (in order):**



- CRIM     per capita crime rate by town      

- ZN       proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.        

- INDUS    proportion of non-retail business acres per town       

- CHAS     Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)       

- NOX      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)        

- RM       average number of rooms per dwelling        

- AGE      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940        

- DIS      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

- RAD      index of accessibility to radial highways       

- TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000        

- PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town        

- B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of black people by town      

- LSTAT    % lower status of the population       

- MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's   

##     Algorithms Used
I have used several Algorithms To predict the price of house and able to achieve the following accuracy.

- Neural Network Accuracy: 85.76 %

- Random Forest Regressor Accuracy: 86.28 %

- Linear Regression Accuracy: 73.52 %

- Ridge Regression Accuracy: 72.94 %

- Lasso Regression Accuracy: 73.52 %

- ElasticNet Regression Accuracy: 73.52 %

**The Maximum achievable accuracy is 86.28 % by using Random Forest Regressor Algorithm**
